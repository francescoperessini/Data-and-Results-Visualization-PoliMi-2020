This is the Repo of the project of the group composed by:

Name - codice persona - matricola

Massimo Pavan 10528264 945302

Francesco Peressini 10523034 928060

In the project we included two notebook files:

the first one is only a work in progress version of what we later delivered in the second notebook, it should not be considered for final evaluation. 
It's been added only for completeness if professor would like to take an eye on the first phases of exploration and visualization.

The data files need to be slightly modified by removing the first spaces in the first line to be correctly opened in the notebooks. We did this for the files that we have used
in our notebooks and included in the folder "Data-and-Results-Visualization-PoliMi-2020\Data\activities".
